# craftroom
A good craftroom is strewn with pipe cleaners, bits of yarn, scraps of fabric, colorful paper, and at least one hot glue gun. When it comes time to make a puppet or a toy or a Halloween costume, the ingredients you need are probably sitting on a shelf somewhere. This is a collection of useful code snippets and tools that hopes to serve the same messy purpose.
